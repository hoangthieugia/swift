## Day 1. Two Sum

>Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
>
>You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
>
>Example:
>
>Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

>Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
>return [0, 1].

## Day 2. Three Sum

> Given an array of integers, find all subsets of the array with 3 values where the 3 values sum up to a target number. 
>
> **Note**: The solution subsets must not contain duplicate triplets.
>
> For example, given the array [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4], and the target **0**:
> The solution set is: [[-1, 0, 1], [-1, -1, 2]] // The two **-1** values in the array are considered to be distinct

>There are 2 key procedures in solving this algorithm. Sorting the array, and avoiding duplicates.
