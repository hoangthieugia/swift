## Day 1. Two Sum

>Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
>
>You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
>
>Example:
>
>Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
>
>Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
>return [0, 1].

## Day 2. Three Sum

> Given an array of integers, find all subsets of the array with 3 values where the 3 values sum up to a target number. 
>
> **Note**: The solution subsets must not contain duplicate triplets.
>
> For example, given the array [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4], and the target **0**:
> The solution set is: [[-1, 0, 1], [-1, -1, 2]] // The two **-1** values in the array are considered to be distinct
>
>There are 2 key procedures in solving this algorithm. Sorting the array, and avoiding duplicates.

## Day 3. Add Two Numbers

> You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single > digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.
>
> You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
>
> Example:
>
> Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
> Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
> Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

## Day 4. Move Zeroes

> Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
> 
> Example:
> 
> Input: [0,1,0,3,12]
> Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
> Note:
> 
> You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
> Minimize the total number of operations.
